# Cloud Computing 
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computing resources (such as storage and infrastructure), as services over the internet. Companies or individuals pay to access a virtual pool of shared resources, including compute, storage, and networking services, which are located on remote servers that are owned and managed by the service providers. This eliminates the need for individuals and businesses to self-manage physical resources, and only pay for what they use. 

When adopting cloud computing architecture, there is no one-size-fits-all. There are three different cloud computing deployment models: public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud.

Public Cloud are run by third-party cloud service providers in their location (edge). 
Private Cloud are built, managed, and owned by a single organization and privately hosted in their own data centers (on-prem).
Hybrid Cloud is a mixed computing environment where applications are run using a combination of computing, storage, and services deployed across public and private cloud.
