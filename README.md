# Cloud Computing 
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computing resources (such as storage and infrastructure), as services over the internet. Companies or individuals pay to access a virtual pool of shared resources, including compute, storage, and networking services, which are located on remote servers that are owned and managed by the service providers. This eliminates the need for individuals and businesses to self-manage physical resources, and only pay for what they use. 

When adopting cloud computing architecture, there is no one-size-fits-all. There are three different **cloud computing deployment models**: public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud.
- Public Cloud are run by third-party cloud service providers in their location (edge). 
- Private Cloud are built, managed, and owned by a single organization and privately hosted in their own data centers (on-prem).
- Hybrid Cloud is a mixed computing environment where applications are run using a combination of computing, storage, and services deployed across public and private cloud.

There are three main types of **cloud computing service models** that you can select based on the level of control, flexibility, and management of business needs:
- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) offers on-demand access to IT infrastructure services, including compute, storage, networking, and virtualization. It provides the highest level of control over IT resources and most closely resembles traditional on-premises IT resources.
- Platform as a service (PaaS) offers all the hardware and software resources needed for cloud application development. With PaaS, companies can focus fully on application development without the burden of managing and maintaining the underlying infrastructure.
- Software as a service (SaaS) delivers a full application stack as a service, from underlying infrastructure to maintenance and updates to the app software itself. A SaaS solution is often an end-user application, where both the service and the infrastructure is managed and maintained by the cloud service provider.

**Cloud-with-benefits**: 
- gives you ablity to scale elastically, both up or down as needed.
- hefty upfront costs of buying and maintaining on-prem hardware is eliminated (for public & hybrid  cloud ppl).
- Large distribution with high tech network facilities makes sure there exsists no down-time and slow responses (again for public & hybrid cloud ppl).  
- Cloud simplifies backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity as the data will be available in multiple locations.

**Amazon Web Services** provides a highly available technology infrastructure platform with multiple locations worldwide. 
- These locations are composed of regions (seperate geographical area) and Availability Zones (isolated locations in region).
- Availability Zones are physically separated within a typical metropolitan region and are located in lower-risk flood plains.
- They are provided with uninterruptable power supply and  redundantly connected to multiple tier-1 transit providers.
- This enables organizations to place resources and data in multiple locations around the globe. Helping to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data is of utmost priority to AWS.

**AWS Cloud Computing Platform** provides more than 200 cloud computing services, The most commonly used are:
#### Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):
Purpose: Provides scalable compute capacity in the cloud.

Used for: Hosting virtual servers to run applications, development, and testing.

#### Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):
Purpose: Object storage service for storing and retrieving any amount of data.

Used for: Storing and retrieving data, backup and restore, static website hosting.

#### Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service):
Purpose: Managed relational database service that simplifies database setup, operation, and scaling.

Used for: Running and managing relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.

#### AWS Lambda:
Purpose: Serverless compute service that runs code in response to events.

Used for: Building and running serverless applications, event-driven computing.

#### Amazon DynamoDB:
Purpose: Fully managed NoSQL database service.

Used for: Fast and flexible NoSQL database for applications with variable and high read/write workloads.

#### Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):
Purpose: Provides a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources.

Used for: Building a secure and scalable network infrastructure within AWS.

#### Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service):
Purpose: Highly scalable, high-performance container management service.

Used for: Running, stopping, and managing Docker containers on a cluster.

#### Amazon Fargate:
Purpose: 

Used for:
