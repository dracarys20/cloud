# Cloud Computing 
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computing resources (such as storage and infrastructure), as services over the internet. Companies or individuals pay to access a virtual pool of shared resources, including compute, storage, and networking services, which are located on remote servers that are owned and managed by the service providers. This eliminates the need for individuals and businesses to self-manage physical resources, and only pay for what they use. 

When adopting cloud computing architecture, there is no one-size-fits-all. There are three different **cloud computing deployment models**: public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud.
- Public Cloud are run by third-party cloud service providers in their location (edge). 
- Private Cloud are built, managed, and owned by a single organization and privately hosted in their own data centers (on-prem).
- Hybrid Cloud is a mixed computing environment where applications are run using a combination of computing, storage, and services deployed across public and private cloud.

There are three main types of **cloud computing service models** that you can select based on the level of control, flexibility, and management of business needs:
- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) offers on-demand access to IT infrastructure services, including compute, storage, networking, and virtualization. It provides the highest level of control over IT resources and most closely resembles traditional on-premises IT resources.
- Platform as a service (PaaS) offers all the hardware and software resources needed for cloud application development. With PaaS, companies can focus fully on application development without the burden of managing and maintaining the underlying infrastructure.
- Software as a service (SaaS) delivers a full application stack as a service, from underlying infrastructure to maintenance and updates to the app software itself. A SaaS solution is often an end-user application, where both the service and the infrastructure is managed and maintained by the cloud service provider.

**Cloud-with-benefits**: 
- gives you ablity to scale elastically, both up or down as needed.
- hefty upfront costs of buying and maintaining on-prem hardware is eliminated (for public & hybrid  cloud ppl).
- Large distribution with high tech network facilities makes sure there exsists no down-time and slow responses (again for public & hybrid cloud ppl).  
- Cloud simplifies backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity. The data will be available in multiple secure locations.
